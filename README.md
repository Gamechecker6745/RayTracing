# RayTracing
A ray tracing experiment
Ray tracing is the simulation of light rays interacting with objects until they hit the camera.
This gives a more realistic sense of a 3D world.
So far, spheres are only supported. 
A proper GUI and triangle support are in progress.
Cheers.
(PyGame module required to run code.)
